# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Random Forest

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a Machine Learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species:
- Iris-setosa  
- Iris-versicolor  
- Iris-virginica  

The model is trained using the RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn.

## 🔍 Workflow
1. Loaded training and testing datasets.
2. Separated features (X) and target variable (y).
3. Trained a Random Forest model.
4. Predicted flower species on test data.
5. Explored how Pandas DataFrames and NumPy arrays work in ML models.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Difference between Pandas and NumPy in ML pipelines.
- How scikit-learn handles categorical labels internally.
- Importance of execution order in Jupyter Notebook.
- Basic ML workflow: train → predict → evaluate.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add model evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix).
- Perform hyperparameter tuning.
- Compare with other algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM).
