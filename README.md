# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Random Forest

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning classification model to predict Iris flower species using the Random Forest algorithm.

The model classifies flowers into three categories:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

The prediction is based on four numerical features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Machine Learning Workflow
1. Loaded training and test datasets.
2. Separated features (X) and target variable (y).
3. Trained a RandomForestClassifier model.
4. Predicted flower species on unseen test data.
5. Evaluated model performance using accuracy calculation.

## 📊 Model Performance
The Random Forest model achieved **97.06% accuracy** on the test dataset.

Accuracy was calculated both:
- Manually using a loop comparison.
- Using `sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score`.

This indicates strong classification performance across the three Iris species.
